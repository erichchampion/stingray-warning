## IMSI Catchers

### What is an IMSI Catcher?

#### IMSI Catcher Definition
An IMSI Catcher (also known as a Stingray, Cell Site Simulator, or Fake Base Station) is a surveillance device that mimics a legitimate cell tower to intercept mobile communications.

#### How They Work
1. Device broadcasts a stronger signal than nearby towers
2. Your phone connects to the fake tower
3. Device intercepts calls, texts, and data
4. May downgrade your connection to vulnerable protocols

#### Common Uses
• Law enforcement surveillance
• Corporate espionage
• Criminal activity monitoring
• Mass surveillance operations

⚠️ **Warning:** IMSI Catchers can intercept your communications, track your location, and compromise your privacy without your knowledge.

## Protection

### How This App Protects You

#### Real-Time Monitoring
Continuously monitors your cellular connection for suspicious patterns and anomalies that may indicate surveillance equipment.

#### 2G Detection
Alerts you when connected to 2G networks, which are vulnerable to interception and commonly used by IMSI catchers.

#### Carrier Validation
Checks for unknown or suspicious carriers that may indicate fake base stations.

#### Pattern Analysis
Detects unusual network behavior patterns like rapid technology changes that may indicate active surveillance.

#### Background Monitoring
Runs monitoring in the background to detect threats even when the app isn't actively open.

✅ **Note:** All analysis is performed locally on your device - no data is sent to external servers.

### Detection Types

#### Rapid Technology Changes
**Description:** Multiple rapid changes between network technologies detected, which may indicate active surveillance equipment.

**Recommended Action:** Consider switching to airplane mode and reconnecting, or moving to a different location.

#### Suspicious 2G Connection
**Description:** Connection to 2G network detected. 2G networks are vulnerable to interception and should be avoided when possible.

**Recommended Action:** Consider switching to airplane mode and reconnecting, or moving to a different location.

#### Unknown Carrier
**Description:** Connection to an unknown or unregistered carrier detected, which may indicate a rogue base station.

**Recommended Action:** Immediately switch to airplane mode and avoid sensitive communications.

#### Unusual Signal Pattern
**Description:** Unusual signal strength patterns detected that may indicate nearby surveillance equipment.

**Recommended Action:** Monitor the situation and consider moving to a different location if patterns persist.

#### Network Downgrade
**Description:** Network technology downgraded unexpectedly, potentially forcing connection to vulnerable protocols.

**Recommended Action:** Consider switching to airplane mode and reconnecting, or moving to a different location.

#### Carrier Spoofing
**Description:** Carrier information appears to be spoofed or inconsistent with expected values.

**Recommended Action:** Immediately switch to airplane mode and avoid sensitive communications.

#### IMSI Catcher Suspected
**Description:** Multiple indicators suggest the presence of an IMSI catcher or similar surveillance device.

**Recommended Action:** Immediately switch to airplane mode and avoid sensitive communications.

### App Limitations

#### Detection Capabilities
This app has significantly limited detection capabilities compared to dedicated SDR (Software Defined Radio) hardware used by security professionals.

#### Sophisticated Attacks
Advanced IMSI catchers may be undetectable by consumer apps. Professional-grade equipment can mimic legitimate carriers perfectly.

#### False Positives
The app may generate false alarms due to legitimate network conditions like poor coverage or carrier maintenance.

#### iOS Limitations
iOS restricts access to low-level cellular information, limiting the app's ability to detect sophisticated threats.

⚠️ **Warning:** This app should be used as a security awareness tool, not as your sole protection against surveillance.

## Best Practices

### Security Best Practices

#### General Security
• Use VPN when possible
• Avoid public WiFi for sensitive activities
• Keep your device updated
• Use encrypted messaging apps
• Be cautious with app permissions

#### When Alerts Occur
• Switch to airplane mode
• Move to a different location
• Avoid sensitive communications
• Wait for normal network conditions
• Report suspicious activity if appropriate

#### Physical Security
• Be aware of your surroundings
• Avoid predictable patterns
• Use Faraday bags for sensitive devices
• Consider professional security assessments

✅ **Remember:** Security is about layers of protection, not relying on any single tool.
